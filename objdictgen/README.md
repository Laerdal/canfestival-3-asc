# Objedictgen

The legacy objdictgen tool has been replaced with a new upgraded tool. This tool
must be installed on your machine and cannot be run from in-source.

Please read the `python-objdictgen`
[README.md](https://github.com/Laerdal/python-objdictgen/blob/main/README.md)
for a description of how to install the tool. The tool works with both Python 3
and ancient Python 2.7. To be able to use the GUI tools Python2.7 with
additional GUI libraries is required.
